<p>Sevoflurane is a General Anesthetic. The physiologic effect of sevoflurane is by means of General Anesthesia.</p>
<p>Sevoflurane is a fluorinated isopropyl ether with general anesthetic property. Although the mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, sevoflurane may act by interfering with the release and re-uptake of neurotransmitters at post-synaptic terminals, and/or alter ionic conductance following receptor activation by a neurotransmitter. Sevoflurane may also interact directly with lipid matrix of neuronal membranes, thereby affecting gating properties of ion channels. In addition, this agent may activate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors hyperpolarizing cell membranes. This results in a general anesthetic effect, a decrease in myocardial contractility and mean arterial pressure as well as an increased respiratory rate.</p>
<p>Sevofurane is one of the most commonly used volatile anesthetic agents, particularly for outpatient anesthesia and has an excellent safety record. Sevoflurane has been implicated in rare single case reports of severe acute liver injury similar to halothane hepatitis.</p>
